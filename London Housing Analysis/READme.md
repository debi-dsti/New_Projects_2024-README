**Project Description**
<br/>
Overview:
<br/>
This project focuses on analyzing crime data using Python and pandas library. The dataset contains information about various crimes, including the date, area, number of crimes, and average price. The objective is to perform data manipulation and analysis to derive meaningful insights and answer specific questions about the data.

**Project Requirments**
-Convert Date Column to Date-Time Format:
-Convert the data type of the "Date" column to a date-time format.
-Add a New Column "Year":
-Add a new column named "Year" to the DataFrame containing the year extracted from the date.
-Add a Month Column Between Date and Area Columns:
-Insert a new column representing the month between the "Date" and "Area" columns.
-Remove Year and Month Columns:
-Remove the "Year" and "Month" columns from the DataFrame.
-Show Records with Zero Number of Crimes:
-Display all records where the "No of Crimes" column has a value of zero and provide a count of such records.
-Find Maximum and Minimum Average Price per Year in England:
-Determine the maximum and minimum "Average Price" per year in England.
-Find Minimum and Maximum Recorded Crime in the Area:
-Identify the minimum and maximum recorded crime counts in the "Area" column.

**Objectives:**
**Data Cleaning and Formatting:**
The first step involves cleaning and formatting the dataset. This includes converting the data type of the "Date" column to a date-time format and adding a new column for the year extracted from the date.
Feature Engineering:
Next, we add a new column representing the month between the "Date" and "Area" columns to provide additional temporal context for the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
I conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This includes identifying records with zero crimes, analyzing crime trends over time, and examining the distribution of crime counts across different areas.
Statistical Analysis:
I performed statistical analysis to answer specific questions about the data. This includes determining the maximum and minimum average price per year in England and identifying the minimum and maximum recorded crime counts in the area.
Usage:
This project can be used to gain insights into crime patterns and trends, identify areas with high or low crime rates, and understand the relationship between crime and other factors such as average price. It serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and researchers interested in crime analysis and prevention.
